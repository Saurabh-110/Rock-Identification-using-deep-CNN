## Description

Rocks play a crucial role in the Earth's structure. Automating the identification of rock types in the field could significantly enhance geological surveys, educational efforts, and mapping processes. This task is essential in both geological research and mineral resource exploration. Due to the challenging working conditions in the field, rock identification is typically limited to visual techniques, such as using a magnifying glass for finer-grained rocks. These visual assessments involve evaluating properties like color, composition, grain size, and texture. These attributes can provide insights into a rock's mineral and chemical makeup, its formation environment, and its origin. For instance, the color of a rock often correlates with its chemical composition. However, manual identification through visual inspection is a time-consuming process. Recent advancements in technology have enabled the use of image analysis for more efficient rock identification. This paper presents a method that utilizes deep convolutional neural networks to accurately identify rock types from field images.
